    Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
    Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
    <em>There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.</em><br>
    And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
    Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
    Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
    Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
    Until one day, you walk.<br>
    <strong>One foot in front of the other</strong>. One idea on top of the next.<br>
    Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
    Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
    <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
    It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
    You just don’t get it, yet.
    Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
    are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
    Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You only have to know one thing:<br>
    You can learn anything.
